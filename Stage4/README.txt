To run this program: 

- Download all files located in the Stage4 directory
	I recommend downloading them via https://download-directory.github.io/
	and extracting all to your desired location.

- After all files have been extracted, navigate to the "dist" folder and double click on the Stage4.jar file to run the program.

As this is a test build, User logins have not been created for each employee nor is there a direct way to add them. 

For manager access: username = AUser
For employee access: username = BUser

for both cases password = pass

AUser will have access to managerial menus such as viewing sensitive information or directly modifying employees

BUser will be unable to access these menus
